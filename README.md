# useOutsideClick Custom Hook

Part 17 of the freeCodeCamp 25 React Projects for interview.

This project demonstrates a custom React hook, useOutsideClick, designed to detect clicks outside a specified element and trigger a handler function. The useOutsideClick hook uses the useEffect hook to add event listeners for 'mousedown' and 'touchstart' events. When a click outside the referenced element is detected, the provided handler function is executed.
